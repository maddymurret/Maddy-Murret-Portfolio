                <h2>With all the challenges and uncertainty of the past 2 years I decided it was time to try something new to challenge my mental and physical needs.

                  I’ve been working out consistently for over a year now and I’m so excited with my progress and growth. I wanted to make this account to keep myself accountable and to stay on track. 
                  
                  I’ve been nervous to take this step and share a more vulnerable side of myself, but if this year has taught me anything it’s that we need to take control of our lives and do the things that make us happy. A constant worry I have every single day is how people see me and what they think. I want to change that mindset.
                  
                  My goal with this page is to show the progression of a healthier lifestyle. I hope to help anyone struggling with negative self-talk and learn together through this crazy life. 
                  
                  Thank you to everyone who pushed me to do this. I can’t wait to see what this new year brings with new food, new places, and new exercise goals
