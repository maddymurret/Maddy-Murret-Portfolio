          <h3>Untapped Market- COD is the 2nd most popular video game among female gamers (Statista).</h3>
          <h3>Taking it Global- Extending Call of Duty beyond just the game allows room to reach a global audience rather than just previous gamers.</h3>
          <h3>Mainstream Culture-Introducing a popular game like Call of Duty as a makeup brand in a major store like Ulta, will be shocking but keep the media talking.</h3>
          <h3>Incentives-Codes will encourage new players to try Warzone and recurring players to buy the products for themselves or their significant other.</h3>
